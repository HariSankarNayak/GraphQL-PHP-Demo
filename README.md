This is a repository demonstrating  how to actually set up GraphQL with PHP but also how to mitigate the infamous `n+1` 
problem by deferring the actual field resolution to a later stage. This implementation uses [DataloaderPHP](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=dataloader-php)
for the dererral.

The project is set up on top of [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com/) v4 which acts as an API.
Slim provides out-of-the-box Monolog support with their Skeleton project that you can use to actually log database queries and see what happens.

Database connection is handled using [Doctrine DBAL](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal) and logged with an `SQLLogger` instance.

GraphQL implementation is provided by [webonyx/graphql-php](https://webonyx.github.io/graphql-php/)

## Instructions

- Download
- Unpack
- Set up a database table (I used MySQL here) and import the `database.sql`    
- Add your database connection settings to app/settings.php `db` section. Defaults are set to localhost demo database.
- cd to project root and run:

`composer install`
    
- Run PHP app with:

`php -S localhost:8080 -t public public/index.php`

## Testing

After you app is running use Postman or any tool you like to send a GraphQL body request to your API which should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`

    query {
        getBooks {
            id
            title
            author {
                id
                name
            }
        }
    }
    

You can afterwards check your `logs/app.log` for the database queries that were executed. The log entry should look like this:

```
{
  "1": {
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM book",
    "params": [],
    "types": [],
    "executionMS": 0.00038886070251464844
  },
  "2": {
    "sql": "SELECT id, `name` FROM author WHERE id in (?)",
    "params": [
      [
        "1",
        "2",
        "3"
      ]
    ],
    "types": [
      101
    ],
    "executionMS": 0.0014162063598632812
  }
}
```
    
So we fetched the books in one query and after getting all the possible author ids for all the books, we queried them in one go.

 right track with using DataLoder to handle promises and setting up field resolvers.
